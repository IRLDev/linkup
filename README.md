## Issues
1. Not enough content in body of page to support included images for scrolling
2. Didn’t setup border/divider scroll with images to hide transition from one image to next
3. Images are royalty free from unsplash, I will find the links and upload
4. Next step for design was a bottom border, similar to top nav bar
5. I did most of this at night on a mac flux managing my screen temperature, that could be why the colours looked incorrect.
6. I didn’t do the breadcrumbs for current location
